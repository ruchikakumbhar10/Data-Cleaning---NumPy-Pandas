# Data-Cleaning---NumPy-Pandas

**📂 Project Overview**

This project focuses on cleaning a real-world messy customer dataset.
The goal is to transform raw, inconsistent, and incomplete data into a clean and reliable dataset ready for analysis.

Data cleaning is a major part of a data analyst’s workflow, and this project reflects how it is handled in practical scenarios using Python.
