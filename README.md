# Data-Cleaning---NumPy-Pandas

## 📂 Project Overview

This Project focuses on Vleaning a real-world Customer Messy Dataset.
The goal is to Transform raw, Inconsistent, and Incomplete data into a clean and reliable dataset ready for analysis.

Data Cleaning is a major part of a Data Analyst’s workflow, and this project reflects how it is handled in practical scenarios using Python.



## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib


## 🔧 Data Cleaning Steps Performed

- Initial data inspection and understanding

- Handling missing values using appropriate techniques (median, mean, mode, forward and backward fill)

- Fixing inconsistent categorical values (Gender, CustomerID formatting)

- Converting date columns to proper datetime format

- Correcting data types

- Removing unnecessary columns

- Identifying and analyzing outliers

- Creating a final clean dataset ready for analysis

## ✅ Final Outcome

- Clean and structured dataset

- Correct data types

- No missing values

- Consistent formatting across columns

- Dataset ready for further analysis or modeling

## 🎯 Key Learning

This project highlights how important data cleaning is before performing any analysis. Clean data improves accuracy, reliability, and confidence in decision-making.
